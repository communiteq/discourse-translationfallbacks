      This is a test email from

      [**%{base_url}**][0]

      Email deliverability is complicated. Here are a few important things you should check first:

      - Be *sure* to set the `notification email` from: address correctly in your site settings. **The domain specified in the "from" address of the emails you send is the domain your email will be validated against**.

      - Know how to view the raw source of the email in your mail client, so you can examine email headers for important clues. in Gmail, it is the "show original" option in the drop-down menu at the top right of each mail.

      - **IMPORTANT:** Does your ISP have a reverse DNS record entered to associate the domain names and IP addresses you send mail from? [Test your Reverse PTR record][2] here. If your ISP does not enter the proper reverse DNS pointer record, it's very unlikely any of your email will be delivered.

      - Is your domain's [SPF record][8] correct? [Test your SPF record][1] here. Note that TXT is the correct official record type for SPF.

      - Is your domain's [DKIM record][3] correct? This will significantly improve email deliverability. [Test your DKIM record][7] here.

      - If you run your own mail server, check to make sure the IPs of your mail server are [not on any email blacklists][4]. Also verify that it is definitely sending a fully-qualified hostname that resolves in DNS in its HELO message. If not, this will cause your email to be rejected by many mail services.

      (The *easy* way is to create a free account on [Mandrill][md] or [Mailgun][mg] or [Mailjet][mj], which have free generous free mailing plans and will be fine for small communities. You'll still need to set up the SPF and DKIM records in your DNS, though!)

      We hope you received this email deliverability test OK!

      Good luck,

      Your friends at [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org)

    post_hidden:
      text_body_template: |
        Hello,

        This is an automated message from %{site_name} to inform you that your post was hidden.

        %{base_url}%{url}

        %{flag_reason}

        Multiple community members flagged this post before it was hidden, so please consider how you might revise your post to reflect their feedback. **You can edit your post after %{edit_delay} minutes, and it will be automatically unhidden.** This will increase your trust level.

        However, if the post is hidden by the community a second time, it will remain hidden until handled by staff – and there may be further action, including the possible suspension of your account.

        For additional guidance, please refer to our [community guidelines](%{base_url}/guidelines).
    usage_tips:
      text_body_template: |
        This private message has a few quick tips to get you started.

        ## Keep scrolling

        There are no next page buttons or page numbers – to read more, **just keep scrolling down!**

        As new posts come in, they will appear automatically.

        ## Where am I?

        - For search, your user page, or the menu, use the **icon <kbd>☰</kbd> buttons at the upper right**.

        - Any topic title will take you to the next unread post. Use the last activity time and post count to enter at the top or bottom.

        - While reading a topic, jump to the top &uarr; by selecting the topic title. Select the green progress bar at the bottom right for full navigation controls, or use the <kbd>home</kbd> and <kbd>end</kbd> keys.

            <img src="/images/welcome/progress-bar.png" width="143" height="39">

        ## How do I reply?

        - To reply to the overall topic, use the Reply button <img src="/images/welcome/reply-topic.png" width="29" height="25">  at the very bottom of the page.

        - To reply to a specific post, use the Reply button <img src="/images/welcome/reply-post.png" width="29" height="25"> on that post.

        - To take the conversation in a different direction, but keep them linked together, use <img src="/images/welcome/reply-as-linked-topic.png" width="15" height="25"> Reply as linked Topic to the right of the post.

        To quote someone in your reply, select the text you wish to quote, then press any Reply button.

        <img src="/images/welcome/quote-reply.png" width="350" height="129">

        To ping someone in your reply, mention their name. Type `@` and an autocompleter will pop up.

        <img src="/images/welcome/username-completion.png" width="230" height="131">

        For [standard Emoji](http://www.emoji.codes/), just start typing `:` or the traditional smileys `:)` :smile:

        ## What else can I do?

        There are action buttons at the bottom of each post.

        <img src="/images/welcome/like-link-flag-bookmark.png" width="169" height="46">

        To let someone know that you enjoyed their post, use the **like** button. If you see a problem with a post, privately let them, or our staff, know about it with the **flag** button.

        You can also **share** a link to a post, or **bookmark** it for later reference on your user page.

        ## Who is talking to me?

        When someone replies to your post, quotes your post, or mentions your `@username`, a number will immediately appear at the top right of the page. Use it access your **notifications**.

        <img src="/images/welcome/notification-panel.png" width="178" height="59">

        Don't worry about missing a reply – you'll be emailed direct replies (and private messages) if you aren't online when they arrive.

        ## When are conversations new?

        By default all conversations less than two days old are considered new, and any conversation you've participated in (replied to, created, or read for an extended period) will automatically be tracked.

        You will see the blue new and number indicators next to these topics:

        <img src="/images/welcome/topics-new-unread.png" width="368" height="89">

        You can change the individual notification state of a topic via the control at the bottom of the topic (this can also be set per category). To change how you track topics, or the definition of new, see [your user preferences](%{base_url}/my/preferences).

        ## Why can't I do certain things?

        New users are somewhat limited for safety reasons. As you participate here, you'll gain the trust of the community, become a full citizen, and those limitations will automatically be removed. At a high enough [trust level](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924), you'll gain even more abilities to help us manage our community together.

      The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

      One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Please spend some time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.

      <a name="agreeable"></a>

      ## [Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree](#agreeable)

      You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But, remember to _criticize ideas, not people_. Please avoid:

      *   Name-calling.
      *   Ad hominem attacks.
      *   Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
      *   Knee-jerk contradiction.

      Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

      <a name="participate"></a>

      ## [Your Participation Counts](#participate)

      The conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be &mdash; and avoiding those that do not.

      Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: favorites, bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.

      Let’s try to leave our park better than we found it.

      <a name="flag-problems"></a>

      ## [If You See a Problem, Flag It](#flag-problems)

      Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

      When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. _Just flag it_. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.

      In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.

      <a name="be-civil"></a>

      ## [Always Be Civil](#be-civil)

      Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

      *   Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
      *   Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
      *   Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
      *   Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

      These are not concrete terms with precise definitions &mdash; avoid even the _appearance_ of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.

      This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

      <a name="keep-tidy"></a>

      ## [Keep It Tidy](#keep-tidy)

      Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

      *   Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
      *   Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
      *   Don’t post no-content replies.
      *   Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
      *   Don’t sign your posts &mdash; every post has your profile information attached to it.

      Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

      <a name="stealing"></a>

      ## [Post Only Your Own Stuff](#stealing)

      You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.
